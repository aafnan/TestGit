Just testing out how to use this Git. 

- To commit changes and push to GitHub
	- you can check the status if you want to by typing the command --> git status
	- OR just type --> git commit -m "the message/comment for the file" nameoffile.txt/whatever
	- Then type the command --> git push -u origin master
